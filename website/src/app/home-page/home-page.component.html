      Welcome to Star Citizen速 Unpacked!
    </h4>
    <p class="mt-4">
      This site aims to provide an easy way to browse and compare the various ships, vehicles, equipment, weapons and armour available in the game. I am still working
      on identifying and extracting all the necessary ship and item statistics, so if you find some stat is not listed please feel free to add an issue in GitHub
      and I'll do my best to add it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Ultimately there will also be a public API to make it easy for other websites to consume the data without having to go through the process of extracting
      the data from the game files first, but while I'm building the site, the data in the API is frequently changing, so it might be a bit frustrating to try
      and use it at the moment.
